#Sinatra-tiny_auth
By Jonathan Davies (ThroughTheNet)

A sinatra extension to provide the simplest possible authentication.

It has no users database, there is only one user. Authentication is by password only.

This is intended for situations where you want to protect a simple sinatra app intended for use by just one person.

#THIS GEM IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! PLEASE DO NOT USE IT ON A REAL WEBSITE IT MAY WELL NOT BE SECURE YET!
